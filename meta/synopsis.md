# ðŸ“– Synopsis

*The Very Last Superhero* is a speculative novel set in a near-future India, where climate collapse, authoritarian control, and digital decay have stripped the world of its myths â€” and its memory. 

Fourteen-year-old Sumati inherits a Salt Lamp from her missing father â€” not just a relic, but a device that stores oral histories. In a Delhi buried beneath surveillance and floodwaters, she sets out to reboot the Resistance archive and uncover what came before the Collapse.
